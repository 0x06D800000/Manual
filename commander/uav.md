## _UAV_ {#uav}

The Commander of conventional forces and the militia are able to control an **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)** from his team&#039;s command post or armored command vehicle (ACV). The UAV in PR:BF2 does not reveal enemy positions automatically but gives the commander the means to observe the battlefield visually from a bird’s eye point of view. The commander can control the UAV&#039;s camera while it cruises at a constant altitude.

The UAV is launched by placing the UAV marker on the command map. This can be done by pressing the UAV icon on the top left of the commander screen or by right clicking on the map and placing the UAV icon. Then to operate it you have to enter the ACV vehicle at the main-base of your team.

**The UAV won’t be up forever.** The UAV loses 0.2% fuel/sec while travelling, 0.1% fuel/sec while operating and refuels at 0.2%fuel/sec at base. You can monitor the fuel by watching the “FUEL” bar on the top left of the commander screen.

The UAV can be sent back to base at any point to **refuel**. Returning to base does not consume any fuel. You can do this by right clicking the UAV icon on the top left side of the commander screen.

The time it takes to deploy the UAV depends on the travel distance. It travels at 50 m/s.

The UAV takes 45 seconds to start/land.

**The UAV camera** has three levels of magnification with thermal vision capabilities. The Militia’s UAV only offers two zoom levels with no thermal vision.

The UAV can be relocated instantly by assigning it a new position on the map. The UAV only operates on 2km and 4km maps due to it being too powerful for small maps.

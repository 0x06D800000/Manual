## _Guiding Squad_ {#guiding-squad}

As explained in the Battlefield Navigation section, the Squad Leader can place markers on the map for his squad members to follow. They will find a marker on their compass to follow as well as an icon on the map. The Squad Leader should use these as often as possible and can also use this to easily get the distance towards a target. He can do this from the mini-map by right clicking it and placing the marker or by pressing the **secondary radio key (T)** and point at the target and using one of the buttons to place the marker.

**Target Build Observe**

**Defend Demolish Move**

The commander can also order you. If you accept the order (**PAGE UP**) your marker will be replaced with the commanderâ€™s order.

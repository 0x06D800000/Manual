## _Requesting Support_ {#requesting-support}

The squad leader can also use his radio to request support from other squads. To do so he must activate his radio and then press **the secondary radio key (T).** This will open up the menu for requesting support and deploying team assets. The lower five commands starting with **“NEED ...”** will place a map marker at your position. They also transmit a radio message to your team to alert them of your request. The **“NEED AREA ATTACK”** request behaves a bit different from the rest. On some maps conventional forces can use this command to request an **artillery barrage**. If your request is approved by the team&#039;s commander, the attack will strike after about one minute. After loading a new map or executing an area attack it takes 30 minutes until it is available again. Similarly unconventional factions have access to a mortar barrage every 20 minutes on most maps.

## _The GTL Designator (GTLD)_ {#the-gtl-designator-gtld}

The Squad Leader kit and Spotter kit used by conventional forces are equipped with **GTLD (Ground Target Laser Designator)** which can be used to observe and to acquire and designate enemy units for attack strikes by allied air units. When using the GTLD, right click to increase your zoom level, then left click to paint a laser target marker. The marker will lock to the target area for 24 seconds, and it has the ability to lock moving targets such as vehicles. You will only be able to lock moving targets once they are stationary. If you lase a target area, the previous lase will disappear. While observing with the GTLD goggles you can access the main radio menu to set map markers, request close air support (CAS) or call fire mortar missions. Doing so will automatically transmit a text message to your team detailing the request. You need to specify the distance to the target using the same method as described for spotting enemies. Unconventional factions can use the green binoculars to spot enemies and request mortar attacks.

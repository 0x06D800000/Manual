## _Deployable Structures_ {#deployable-structures}

Here is a list of the deployable structures and the requirements for building them. Deployable assets can be either dismantled with a shovel or alternatively destroyed with C4, IEDs, tank shells, APC shells, or any over forms of heavy ordnance. Deployables can also be completely destroyed by continuing to damage the base of the emplacement. Forward outposts and hideouts can be destroyed as well by ordnance or C4 plastic explosives and TNT. Squad leaders can remove unbuilt deployable emplacements with the radio in a similar way to how they were deployed, by alternatively using the right click to remove the deployable base. The alternate fire mode for the entrenchment tool also has the ability to dismantle unbuilt deployable emplacements. An important note on the requirements and limitations listed below is that all values about distance to an FOB and the maximum amount of assets per FOB are doubled on the CNC gamemode (except for the amount of mortars). Also remember that 2 large supply crates can also be replaced by 4 small supply crates or 1 large and 2 small crates. _(To learn more about logistics see_ [_Logistics section_](../the_basics/logistics.md)_)_

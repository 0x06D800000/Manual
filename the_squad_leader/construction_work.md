## _Construction Work_ {#construction-work}

Constructing assets is an essential functionality of the Squad Leader which the team&#039;s Commander also possesses. When deploying and constructing a Forward Outpost (FOB) a Squad Leader needs to have an officer kit and a heavy supply crate within a 50m radius of his vicinity. 2 light supply crates offer the same capabilities as 1 heavy supply crate to achieve the same goal. Insurgents, Taliban and the Hamas can only deploy hideouts, mortars and anti-tank positions for their team which do not require supplies to build these structures. To perform this function either a cell leader or collaborator kit is necessary.

To deploy a structure follow these steps:

1.  Select and activate the radio / cellphone.
2.  Look in the direction where the structure should be positioned. It will be placed 10m in front of you.
3.  Once you deploy it, press the **secondary radio menu key (T).**
4.  Left click your mouse on **DEPLOY / REMOVE ASSET.**
5.  Select the structure you want to build from the list.

Players currently standing where the deployable is being placed will die. So make sure your squad knows where you intend to build. Soldiers need to use **the entrenching tool** to build assets. Construction is complete once the digging stops.

Place the deployables on open terrain non obstructed area to avoid undesirable effects and unwanted placement locations. The deployable will only appear if its placement location isn&#039;t too far above or below your position.

To dismantle a built structure, squad members must use the entrenching tools right click to destroy an emplacement, then the Squad Leader is able to right-click **DEPLOY / REMOVE ASSET** menu whilst pointing towards the object no more than 5m away, to completely remove it.

Deployable Emplacements weapons can be rearmed by dropping ammunition bags next to them. Several bags are needed to completely rearm an emplacement.

## _The Civilian_ {#the-civilian}

When playing on the Iraqi insurgent or Hamas faction, players can choose to play as the Civilian. This roleâ€™s primary focus is to gather intelligence on Coalition forces and to run interference for the insurgent Cell Leaders. This kit does not come equipped with any weapons but has a wide variety of equipment and tools. Civilians can use their cellphones to spot enemy troops for their team by placing a marker on the map. If a Civilian is killed, it takes 2 minute to respawn if they are arrested. This is the penalty if a civilian is captured and the Coalition forces gain intelligence in order to discover a weapons cache.

The opposing force can **arrest civilians** as well as other insurgents with the restrainer or the Shotgun with a buckshot round. Civilians that decide to commit suicide are counted as an arrested and subsequently reward the coalition team with **Intelligence Points**, after which it can take about 60-75 seconds to respawn.

The Iraqi Insurgent gets a shovel and binoculars while the Hamas only gets a cellphone as equipment.

To get a civilian kit one must drop their current kit (**G**) and wait 2 minutes.

Civilians, unarmed Insurgents and Hamas fighters are bound by particular **rules of engagement** (ROE). If a civilian does any of the following listed below, he will be considered a combatant for 2 minute afterwards and may be shot without penalty:

*   Pick up a kit with a weapon or use a vehicle
*   Perform a resuscitation or administer an epinephrine shot

A civilian will also be punished if he dies within 5m horizontally and 1.5m vertically of armed insurgents.

If you shoot a civilian, you will face several penalties:

*   After your next death you will respawn 120 seconds later per civilian shot (stacks up to 5 minutes additional delay)
*   You will not be able to request any kits for 10 minutes
*   Your score is reduced to 0 and the kill will not be listed on the scoreboard
*   Your team loses 10 intelligence points

Running over civilians in a vehicle or killing them while climbing ladders or ropes will also result in a penalty if done outside of the ROE.

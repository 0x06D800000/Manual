## _Kit Request Procedure_ {#kit-request-procedure}

To request a standard, infantry or limited kit you need to meet the four requirements:

*   You must be at the correct **location**
*   **You must be in a squad** with enough players to request that class of kit, without it being taken already
*   The requested kit must be **available** in the kit pool
*   You must be **granted permission** by your Squad Leader to request the kit

**Location requirement:**

Depending on the kit type you want to request you need to be at one of the following locations:

**All request-able kits:**

*   At the supply depot (or command post)
*   At the team&#039;s supply crate or weapons cache
*   At the rear of a friendly APC or IFV

**Vehicle kits:**

*   At a vehicle that needs the requested kit to be operated (Armor, Helicopter, Aircraft)

**The unarmed kit:**

*   Request-able anywhere
*   You can&#039;t request kits while you are in a vehicle. You also can not request the unarmed kit for 15 seconds after exiting a vehicle.

To request a limited kit at the specified locations, you have to hold down the **secondary radio key (T)** and then select **REQUEST / DROP KIT**. This opens a sub-menu with a list of kits to choose from. If your request was granted, the new kit can be found directly at your feet, and it will tell you with an orange message:

**“Your kit has been ALLOCATED and is at your feet”**

You need to press the **pickup key (G)** to take it. If your request was denied, you will see a player specific orange message explaining why you didn’t receive the kit:

**“You need to be close to a friendly SUPPLY CRATE or APC to request this kit”**

**“You need to be close to a friendly SUPPLY CRATE or VEHICLE to request this kit”**

To obtain the unarmed kit you simply need to hold down the secondary radio key, press the right mouse button to select the drop kit option.

When requesting kits from a crate or vehicle, whilst in the sub-menu you are able to right click to request the alternate kit for that class of weapon, for which there are many variants. Alternatively in the spawn menu there are also the STD and ALT buttons to switch.

**Squad requirement:**

Infantry and specialized kits have a minimum number of players in the squad as requirement before being able to select it. Use the table below to find the default values for infantry and specialized kits as well as a few exceptions to this rule. **All infantry and special kits can only be requested once in a squad except for the medic, sniper and civilian of which you can have up to 2 in each squad.**

| Kit | Minimum | Kit | Minimum |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Infantry Default | 4 | **Machine Gunner** | 6 |
| Special Default | 3 | **Officer** | 2 |
| Grenadier | 6 | **Medic** | 2 |

It will again show you with a message when you are not fulfilling the requirement:

**“Unavailable due to squad limitations”**

**Availability requirement:**

Infantry and special kits are drawn from a pool. The number of available kits depends on the amount of players currently on your team. The spawn-able and vehicle kits are not limited in number. If the kit is not in the following table it means it uses the default requirements for infantry and specialized kits.

| Kit | 1-7 Players | 8-15 Players | 16-23 Players | 24-31 Players | 32- 50+ Players |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Infantry Default | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
| Special Default | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| HAT | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Sniper | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| Rifleman AT | 1 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 8 |
| Civilian | 1 | 3 | 9 | 12 | 16 |

When an infantry kit has been dropped and is not picked up within 5 minutes it disappears from the world and returns to the pool. Specialist kits take 10 minutes to return to the pool. It will show you an orange message if the kit in unavailable:

**“All of these kits have been issued”**

**Allowance requirement:**

Insurgents can&#039;t request kits. The commander of a team may only request the officer kit. Certain actions temporarily prevent you from requesting kits:

*   When you are issued a limited kit you will need to wait 2 minutes before you can request another one.
*   If you change squads, you cannot request a kit for a further 2 minutes.
*   Teamkilling someone who carries a limited kit blocks you for 3 minutes.
*   If you kill a civilian violating the ROE, you will be blocked for 10 minutes.
*   If you spam kit requests, you will be blocked for 30 seconds.

Not all kits are available for all factions. If you don’t have the kit available to you the game will tell you:

**“Unavailable for your forces”**

**“You can&#039;t get another limited kit so soon after your last”**

**“You are new to this squad, request again in a minute”**

# **Kits** {#kits}

There are many different kits in PR:BF2\. You can pick up any friendly kit that you find on the battlefield but you can&#039;t utilize enemy combatant kits. If you pick up such a kit you will be warned and will have about 30 seconds to drop the kit to avoid being killed. 15 seconds after picking up an enemy kit your screen will fade to black and at this point it will have to be dropped. Kits can be characterized into 3 main groups:

*   Spawn-able: unlimited / specialized / infantry
*   Request-able: unlimited / specialized / infantry
*   Pick-up

**All spawn-able kits** can be obtained by selecting one on the spawn screen. **Request-able kits** can only be requested after spawning from crates or vehicles. Insurgents cannot request any kits but have access to **pick-up kits** in their bases and at weapons caches.

**Unlimited kits** can be obtained by anyone. Each request-able **specialized** infantry kit is only available to select number of players per team at the same time.

## _Command &amp; Control (CNC)_ {#command-control-cnc}

This game mode features large freeform battles. There are no capturable CPs, but instead each team must place a single forward operating base (FOB) [_(see deployables Section)_](../the_squad_leader/deployable_structures.md) somewhere on the map. The objective is to defend the team&#039;s FOB while trying to find and destroy the enemy FOB. When a team loses their FOB they will suffer a huge ticket penalty and continue to lose tickets until they build a new one. The FOB must be placed at least 200m from the map&#039;s borders. Building your teamâ€™s FOB closer to the map&#039;s center increases the ticket loss that the enemy will suffer while their FOB is down. Both teams can build more defenses in a bigger radius near their FOB than in other game modes.

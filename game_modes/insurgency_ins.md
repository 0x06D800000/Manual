## _Insurgency (INS)_ {#insurgency-ins}

This mode is very unique in comparison to others within PR. The objective of the coalition force is to find and destroy five insurgent weapons caches hidden throughout the map before running out of tickets. The coalition forces lose tickets for every player death or asset destroyed, while the insurgency team only loses tickets when a weapons cache is destroyed.

The Coalition troops are required to gather intelligence by killing insurgent fighters or capturing insurgent civilians _(_[_see Civilian section_](../kits/the_civilian.md)_)_. To capture a civilian, a Coalition player must be within a meter of the civilian and must either use a restrainer, which consists of a pair of ziptie plastic handcuffs, accessible by selecting the number 1 on your keyboard, or alternatively using a shotgun loaded with breaching slugs. This simulates immobilizing the civilian with a rubber buckshot. The coalition wins if they manage to destroy 5 weapons caches before they run out of time or tickets, otherwise the insurgent team wins the game. Insurgent Engineers can also repair damaged caches.

To reveal the approximate location of insurgent weapons caches while playing Insurgency, intelligence has to be gathered by the coalition forces. The following list shows the amount of intelligence points (IP) gained or lost due to different actions.

*   Insurgent killed: +1 IP (within 300m)
*   Civilian or insurgent arrested: +10 IP
*   Civilian killed (violating rules of engagement): -10 IP

The approximate location of the first cache is shown about 5 minutes into the round. Additional locations will be revealed 5 minutes after enough IP is gained by the coalition. There can be up to 2 active caches at the same time. The new location is revealed when reaching 50 intelligence points. If there are less than 32 players on the server the IP needed to reveal a cache is halved.

The map markers for insurgency are:

**Known Coalition Weapons Cache:** This icon will be visible on the map of the coalition forces which indicates the cacheâ€™s approximate location when sufficient intelligence has been acquired

_(The marker can be offset up to 75m)_

**Known Insurgent Weapons Cache:** This icon will be visible on the map of the insurgent forces which indicates that the cache has been located by the coalition forces.

**Unknown Insurgent Weapons Cache:** This icon will represent the position of the cache where it will spawn on the battlefield. They are only visible to the insurgent forces so that they can co-ordinate their defenses while the coalition forces are gathering intelligence. The cache will not be physically spawned yet until it is revealed to the coalition forces.

The caches can be destroyed by small or large packs of C4\. Other weaponry will only do no or light damage to a cache.

Once it is destroyed the coalition team gains 30 tickets and a message will inform the team about how many caches remain to be destroyed. Caches can be repaired by wrench or shovels.

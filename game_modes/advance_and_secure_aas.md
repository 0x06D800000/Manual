## _Advance and Secure (AAS)_ {#advance-and-secure-aas}

The AAS game mode is the closest to the original BF2 Conquest mode. The objective is to capture all of the control points (CPs) while maintaining more tickets than the enemy. CPs can only be captured in a linear order to simulate a shifting front line and focus engagements. CPs that are in play to be captured are indicated by an orange attack marker while those that need to be defended against enemy attacks are highlighted with a purple defend marker. If your team reaches its last blue defensible flag and that is captured by the opposing force, you will start to bleed tickets until you recapture your flag by force. In a similar fashion the opposing forces last CP is indicated by a red attack marker and will cause them to bleed tickets if your team captures it in the same manner.

At least a minimum of 2 players need to be within the CP capture radius in order to seize the flag. It can take more than a minute to secure a CP depending on the ratio of attackers to defenders within the flag radius. Although you cannot capture CPs out of order, you can begin to neutralize or capture the next CP forward before the current CP has finished capturing/neutralizing, even if you lose another position during the capture period. If a CP controlled by one team is neutralized and captured by the enemy, the team will lose 30 tickets. One of the key-features of AAS is that each time the same layer is loaded, it could be a different flag-layout thanks to our randomized flag-layouts.

The map-markers for AAS are:

**Defend Marker (with ticket bleed) Attack Marker (with ticket bleed)**

**Defend Marker Attack Marker**

Vehicle Warfare, Skirmish &amp; COOP use similar map markers for attack and defend.

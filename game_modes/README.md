# **Game Modes** {#game-modes}

Project Reality:BF2 features 6 different game modes with different objectives. The common goal of all game modes is to reduce the enemy team&#039;s reinforcement points (also referred to as tickets) to zero. In most game modes this is achieved by wounding and killing enemies, destroying their vehicles and by capturing their control points. Colored map markers indicate your current objectives in each game mode.

PR:BF2 features over 40 maps with over 250 different layers. You can find all maps and their specific map information on [http://www.realitymod.com/mapgallery/](http://www.realitymod.com/mapgallery/).

Most game modes feature 4 layer variations to it with different assets and support available. The layers include:

*   **Infantry (16):** This layer usually consists of just transport vehicles, with a focus on infantry fighting.
*   **Alternative (32):** This layer is used by mappers to create a unique set-up, which can include night-time environments, a different flag layout, alternate factions or a blend of assets from the infantry and standard layers.
*   **Standard (64):** This layer usually involves the entire map and all assets, as applicable to the map.
*   **Large (128):** This layer is designed for 100-player servers and usually contains all of the assets from the standard layer with more transports to accommodate the additional troops.

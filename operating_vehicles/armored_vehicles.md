## _Armored Vehicles_ {#armored-vehicles}

*   Tanks and IFVs have separate driver &amp; gunner seats. To use the gunner&#039;s position a driver or cupola gunner must be present. After switching to the gunner seat you must wait 30 seconds before you can aim the cannon.
*   The driver and gunner in a vehicle must be in the same squad.
*   Tank drivers and certain APC/IFVs have a **commander view mode** which provides a 360° view around the turret. This can be accessed by pressing 2\.
*   Drivers and gunners can **zoom** their view by pressing the pop smoke key (**X**). Some tank drivers must first change to the commander view.
*   Most tanks and IFVs can use **thermal optics** in addition to their normal views. You can switch to the thermal mode by using secondary radio menu (**T**) and selecting **“DAY / THERMAL”.**

_Thermal Vision_

*   Armored vehicles have no warning sound when they are targeted by rocket launchers or when missiles are fired at them.
*   Armored vehicles have realistic materials. This means that front and turret armor is stronger than the one in the rear and top of the vehicle. Sides of vehicles and the tracks usually have the middle ground when it comes to armor strength.
*   Tanks and IFVs usually have up to 4 types of ammunition:
    *   **Armor-piercing (AP):** For attacking enemy armored vehicles.
    *   **High Explosive (HE)** (loaded by pressing 2): Effective against soft targets (jeeps, houses, helicopters, covered infantry, etc.)
    *   **Anti-tank missiles** (loaded by pressing 3): Used against heavy armor.
    *   **Co-axial MG** (fired using the alternate fire key): Used against infantry.
*   Tank drivers and certain other vehicles can **deploy smoke** by pressing the alternate fire key.

Tank &amp; IFV gunners deploy it by selecting its weapon slot (usually 3) and pressing the fire key to launch a volley of smoke bombs. Each of them can fire 2 volleys (the gunner has to wait 60s between volleys).

*   For certain vehicles the smoke will be **IR-blocking** meaning it will also block on thermal vision. For other (older vehicles) you will be able to see through the smoke on thermal vision.

## _General Vehicle Information_ {#general-vehicle-information}

*   Light vehicles, trucks and boats &amp; most jeeps (except light armored ones) can be operated by any soldier. Armored vehicles, helicopters and aircraft need specified vehicle kits to operate. Players not using the correct kit will not be able to steer the vehicle or use the weapons. You can&#039;t enter or use enemy vehicles. For ground vehicles you then require a **Crewman** kit. For aircraft &amp; helicopters it’s the **Pilot** kit. These are either requestable by the vehicle or by a supply crate.
*   External views for vehicles have been removed. But for certain vehicles there are custom cameras like the trucks can watch behind them (**C**).
*   You can **aim down the sights** of static and vehicle-mounted MGs by pressing the change camera key(**C**).
*   Vehicle-mounted automatic weapons often have **overheating**. Watch the heat-HUD element on the lower right corner.
*   Vehicle-mounted MGs use ammunition belts. They are reloaded automatically but are limited in number.
*   Vehicles can be **resupplied &amp; repaired** at the supply depot. Or use the repair drop that any logistics truck can drop. Aircraft and Helicopters are automatically repaired and rearmed at their spawn location.
*   Insurgents have **suicide vehicles** like an orange dumpster truck or small civilian cars packed with C4\. You can detonate these with the alternative fire key.
*   When exiting a moving ground vehicle you’ll take damage depending on its speed. You’ll be severely wounded if you exit a burning vehicle.
*   When vehicles take much damage they may become unable to move or traverse their turret until fully repaired.
*   Vehicles that **fire wire-guided missiles** need to be stationary for about 7 seconds before they can fire their weapon.
*   Switching vehicle-weapons (ammo type) will usually cause a delay before you can fire.
*   You can use **Left CTRL+Mouse movement** to freelook when operating most vehicles such as helicopters, jets, jeeps, boats and trucks. APCs and IFVs do not have this feature as they use dedicated cameras.

## _Helicopters_ {#helicopters}

*   Helicopters have a **warm-up time** of around 30 seconds. If too much thrust is generated while the rotor blades spin up, the pilot will lose control and crash. To start the helicopter you have to leave the throttle at idle for at least 30 seconds before trying to lift off.
*   Helicopter pilots can look in other directions while flying by pressing the 6, 7, 8 and 9 keys which you can map to a joystick POV HAT Switch. To look forwards again press 1 or select any other weapon your aircraft has.
*   The rudder controls are mostly effective at low speeds. At higher speeds you need to bank the helicopter to turn.
*   Players using **the pilot kit cannot occupy any of the passenger seats** of an aircraft. This is to stop players using the pilot kit as some kind of SF paratrooper assault kit because it has a parachute. If you have had to bail out of your aircraft and then receive a pickup from another aircraft, ensure you drop your pilot kit before entering the aircraft’s passenger seat otherwise you will be killed.
*   The pilot of Heavy Attack Helicopters aka Gunships can fire the **unguided rockets** while the gunner controls the cannon and guided missiles.
*   Gunners in attack helicopters can zoom their weapons camera by pressing the cycle camera key (**C**) or by pressing the F9 to F11 keys. They can also switch to a thermal imaging mode by using the secondary radio menu (**T**) and selecting **“DAY / THERMAL”** to toggle between the two.
*   The attack-helicopter&#039;s **gunner** has 4 different modes to choose from:

1.  First-person view in the cockpit
2.  Gun-camera which controls the helicopter&#039;s gun
3.  **Laser-guided fire mode (LG)** allows a semi-manual targeting mode, where you can click on the target and the missile will guide itself towards it and click again to update the targets location to the missile in flight.
4.  **Laser-targeted fire mode** **(LT)** (fire-and-forget) locks the missile onto a laser target provided by ground troops or a scout helicopter. The laser targeted mode is the best choice if a spotter can designate the target. It allows minimal exposure of the helicopter. The laser guided mode allows the best tracking of moving targets. However if the target hasn’t been “lazed” correctly or badly, or simply for some reason the missile can’t see the target after launch like if a building gets in the way, the missile may miss.

*   Helicopter crews need to be in the same squad.
*   Helicopters must return to the helipad and land to be **rearmed/repaired**. On Carriers you can only reload on the “ramp” of the carrier, off the runway, this doesn&#039;t include the lifts.
*   To successfully **drop supplies** from a transport helicopters the pilot needs to conduct the drop from an altitude under 5m / 15 feet by pressing the alternate fire key.
*   **Countermeasure flares** are limited and need to be rearmed when expended. Every time you deploy flare(**X**) one flare will be deployed. You can hold down for deploying multiple.

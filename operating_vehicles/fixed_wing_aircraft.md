## _Fixed Wing Aircraft_ {#fixed-wing-aircraft}

*   Aircraft have a **warm-up time** of 30 seconds before they can take off from the ground.
*   Jet pilots can look in other directions while flying by pressing the 7, 8 and 9 keys which you can map to a joystick POV HAT Switch. To look forwards again press 1 or select any other weapon your aircraft has.
*   To slowly **taxi** on the ground keep the throttle neutral and push the stick forward or press the up arrow key, to slowly move in that direction. Pull the stick back or press the down arrow key to reverse. To steer left and right use the rudder controls (**A &amp; D**).
*   To **take off** you need to put the throttle on maximum and then wait a little for the plane to start accelerating. When you are down 2/3 of the runway gently start pulling on the stick and maybe add some afterburner.
*   Most aircraft come equipped with a **cannon and several external weapons**. The primary fire key will fire the cannon (if your aircraft has one) while the alternate fire key will fire the currently selected weapon such as bombs and missiles.
*   To **re-arm and repair** you do need to land the aircraft at your airbase and taxi to the “ramp” or on some very few maps, on the runway. It takes quite some time to rearm completely. On Carriers you can only reload on the “ramp” of the carrier, off the runway. This doesn&#039;t include the lifts.
*   **Air-to-ground weapons** in single seat aircraft need an established laser lock to hit a target. The recommended procedure for an attack with them is explained below:

1.  Ground troops find a suitable target for an air attack.
2.  The troops contact the pilot either directly through mumble/text chat and/or by placing a CAS marker.
3.  The pilot informs the ground troops of his approach using the **“ON THE WAY”** command from his main radio menu and/or through mumble/text chat.
4.  As the pilot approaches the target, the ground troops mark the target with a **GTLD laser** designator, if the laser is slightly off from the target, the missile may miss.
5.  When the target is locked-on the pilot receives a sound cue. He may now release the bomb/missile.

*   **Two-seater aircraft** allow the weapons systems officer (WSO) to identify and engage targets by himself while using the TV targeting mode. The targeting modes work in the same way as in attack helicopters.
*   The commander can place a laser target from his map. Since this method is not very precise it should only be used to bomb static targets.
*   Aircrafts don&#039;t have a nose camera but you can still look back by pressing the cycle camera key (**C**) or F11 to look back, and F9 or a weapon key to look forwards again.
*   **Flares** are triggered individually(**X**) and need to be rearmed after all of them have been dropped. Since the warning sound is only played once the enemy has already locked onto your aircraft for half a second, it is recommended to use them while on an attack run to reduce the chance of the enemy establishing a lock. Just like with helicopters you can hold the key down to deploy multiple.
*   **To land** in PR:BF2 you need to plan ahead much longer than in BF2\. Here are some tips on how to make your first landings easier:

1.  You need to reduce your speed in advance until you can just stay level without falling out of the sky (about 40% power) with the stall airspeed being different for each aircraft. (You can find the stall speed of your aircraft yourself by just going up high and slowing your aircraft down until it starts to lose control and fall, but doing it up high will mean you can regain control by opening up the throttle and pointing your nose down, then just stay above that stall speed while landing, until your wheels hit the ground.)
2.  When you are at this speed you should start your approach.
3.  Imagine a point on the map by extending the runway by about 1km.
4.  Fly to this point and turn towards the runway.
5.  When you are about 200m from the runway cut your throttle.
6.  Once you have touched the ground pull back on the stick to slow down the planes all handle individually.

*   Each aircraft handles differently. For more detailed instructions on their different landing procedures as of Project Reality 0.9 check out [this instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GB9GjfnIOU) by retired developer **Spearhead**.

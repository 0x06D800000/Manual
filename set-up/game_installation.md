## _Game Installation_ {#game-installation}

With PR:BF2 v1.3 it is **no longer required to have Battlefield 2** installed. PR:BF2 v1.3 and beyond works as a standalone game. If you have a version of PR:BF2 installed you will need to uninstall this before you install PR:BF2 v1.3\. **There is no patch available from and older version to v1.3**!

You have to download the full PR:BF2 installer from our website. There won’t be a requirement to have Battlefield 2 installed.

The installer download uses the [Torrent Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrent_file) which can be used with free software such as [qBittorrent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/). The download comes in the form of an “[ISO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image)”-file. To install it depends on your operation system:

*   Windows 8 and beyond feature mounting as part of the Operating System. Right click the ISO and select **Mount** or double click the ISO. This will start the installer.
*   If you are on windows 7 or below you have a few options:
    1.  Burn it to a DVD.
    2.  Mount the ISO file using free software such as [Virtual CloneDrive](http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html).
    3.  Extract the ISO file using free software such as [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinRar](http://www.rarlab.com/).

A few more points:

*   With the new standalone version there is also no longer a requirement to install it in the Battlefield 2 folder. Feel free to install PR:BF2 in a drive and folder of your choosing.
*   If you have BF2 installed you can continue to play it and player other BF2 modifications as well. PR:BF2 does not interfere with them.
*   PR:BF2 features **an auto-updater.** So once you have installed PR:BF2 you can use the updater to automatically update your game to newer versions when they are released.
*   PR:BF2 v1.3 includes PR Mumble in its installation. So there is no need to download this separately.
*   If you don’t want to use Torrents you will find mirrors for direct HTTP downloads through our forums.

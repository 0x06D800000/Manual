## _The PR Launcher_ {#the-pr-launcher}

After installation a shortcut for Project Reality:BF2 v1.3 will be provided on the desktop, double click on this icon to open the Launcher. When the launcher appears you will be greeted with a player profile setup, here you can either create a new account, retrieve or import a pre-existing PR player profile. To import your profile select the desired profile from the list and then click import. Since DICE and EA removed support for BF2 in May 2014 we now use our own account-service for PR:BF2\. All your old BF2 accounts (before PR:BF2 v1.2) are no longer retrievable. We share our account service with the Forgotten Hope 2 modification for BF2.

If you are new to BF2:PR and have never made a profile before, just click ‘Create New Account’ and fill in the required details and pick a sensible, easy to pronounce username. To play on PR multiplayer servers you need to create an online profile. You can alternatively create an offline profile if you choose to.

After creating a profile and logging in, you are presented with the main menu of the PR launcher. All options are displayed on the right.

**Play:** This will start the game. If you click the down arrow to the right, you have the option to check for updates or select a different profile. If there is an update it will be automatically displayed if you press the play button. This update will then automatically be downloaded and installed. Progress of the update and installation will be displayed whilst it is in operation.

**Options:** In this menu you can edit your video, graphics, and audio settings. Also some other options are available as well as configuring PR Mumble keys.

**Support:** This is handy for when you are running into issues. It offers many utilities such as clearing cached folders or giving you a detailed information display of your computer specifications. This comes in handy when contacting our support team.

**Credits:** Here you can see the entire PR:BF2 team who worked on this mod for many years.

**Donate:** A direct link to our online donation page.

**Exit:** Use this button to close the PR Launcher and return to Windows

_The launcher’s main menu also provides a news ticker at the bottom highlighted in blue with announcements of upcoming events, developmental progress and developer blogs from the PR:BF2 community._

## _PR Mumble_ {#pr-mumble}

In game, Mumble is the program which we use to communicate to each other in PR:BF2, which replaces BF2 vanilla’s Voice-Over-IP (VOIP) system. The main unique feature of PR Mumble is that its primary method of communication is transmitted within 3D space, which is directional and proximity based. This is called Local. What this means is that all players on your team can talk to each other if they are nearby, and you can hear in what direction they are speaking from, similarly you can judge how far away they are, just like in real life.

After joining a squad you gain access to that squad’s Radio Net, which allows you to transmit to other players in your squad no matter where you are on the map. Squad leaders also have access to an additional Radio Net that allows them to communicate directly to the commander, globally to all other squad leaders, and directly to an individual squad leader. When using a radio net, a transmission cue will be heard when activating and deactivating the radio (which can be activated in the launcher audio options). The default keys for transmitting over mumble are as follows:

*   **Local speech (H):** you talk to players in the 3D radius space around you.
*   **Squad Radio (Num 0):** you talk to your squad, no matter where you are.
*   **Squad Leader to all other squad leaders radio (*):** you talk to all squad leaders at the same time. This radio net is also available to the commander to use with the same shortcut.
*   **Squad Leader to specific squad leader radio (Num 1Num 9):** you talk to one specific squad leader in your team. These channels on the net are also available to the commander to use with the same shortcut.
*   **Squad leader to Commander Radio (/):** you talk to the commander in private.

PR Mumble comes installed together with PR:BF2\. It runs alongside the game installation and does all client side tasks automatically for you such as starting and connecting you to the right mumble-server. Players have the choice to configure their communication settings to their satisfaction just like the previous version. This includes input and output devices, volumes and the keyboard shortcuts. The two most important keys are default: Local channel (H) and squad radio net (0 on the numpad).The main keyboard shortcuts can be edited in the PR Launcher also via the options menu under the PR Mumble tab.

It’s recommended that you also check the main settings panel directly within the mumble application to make sure it’s all correctly set-up. To do this, locate the PR Dogtags in the system tray next to the Windows system clock (PR has to be running), click on the icon to open the mumble interface then locate settings at the top. After that the settings panel will appear and you can configure your input and output audio devices and alter more keyboard shortcuts and other settings.

PR Mumble also integrates with BF2’s HUD display. During the game you will see the names of players talking, each colour depicting over which channel they are transmitting, which is displayed in the lower left hand corner of your screen. In the lower right hand corner mumble also indicates over what channel you are transmitting with a different colour depending on the channel you are using. It also shows whether your microphone or speakers are muted, and if there’s linking issues with the mumble client.

## _Troubleshooting_ {#troubleshooting}

*   PR:BF2 has its own file verification before you start the game. You will not be able to play online with modified files. You can still use them offline.
*   PR:BF2 needs to be started using the PR Launcher. Launching BF2.EXE or PRBF2.EXE will not work.
*   In addition to the built-in server browser you can use the web-based [PRSpy](http://realitymodfiles.com/geze/prspy/)to browse and join PR:BF2 servers. PRSpy also features a friend-list which makes locating your friends much easier.

*   There is also an Android-app of the same name. This app allows you to see server information, current map, online players and a map gallery with detailed description of the assets presents in every layout. Besides this, you can enable notifications that will inform you when a server is playing your favourite map or game mode. You can find it [here.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.uturista.prspy&hl=en)
*   If the server you want to join is full you now have the option of using Auto Deploy. Select the server, click on “SERVER INFO” and then “AUTO DEPLOY”. A dialog will open that explains the remaining steps. Then simply sit back and wait to be connected once a slot opens up.
*   The Support Menu in the PR Launcher can come in very handy. It can gather all system information of your computer for you to copy and paste into our Support forums for when you need assistance. It can also provide you with your CD-Key Hash.

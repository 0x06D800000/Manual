## _Health Management_ {#health-management}

Weapons in Project Reality are highly lethal and it is only a matter of time until you are shot and start bleeding. Although the HUD in PR doesn’t contain a health bar, once your health drops below 75% there will be audible and visual cues to warn you such as a bloody vision whilst coughing or screaming.

**Healing**

If your injuries are not treated, you will slowly bleed to death. To prevent this you have two ways of healing yourself. Almost every kit includes a **field dressing** which is selected by pressing the appropriate key or cycling through your weapon selection. Pressing fire throws it onto the ground. Within a second or two, the field dressing will disappear and the player standing next to it will regain 25% of their total health.

Since most kits only have one or two field dressings, a better way to regain health is to be treated by a medic. **Medics** are able to completely heal a player by using a **first aid kit** and can be called to your position by using the “Q” radio key and then selecting “Need Medic”. The medic will select the first aid kit by pressing the appropriate number key or cycling through their weapon selection. However, unlike in BF2, the medic can’t just throw the first aid kit on the ground but instead must hold it in their hands, be touching the player to be healed, and then hold down the left mouse button. A sound simulating bandages being ripped will designate that first aid is being applied. To be fully healed takes about 15 seconds, so be sure to do this in a safe spot.

**Reviving**

If you are unable to be healed in time, you will become unconscious and the screen will say you’ve been critically wounded. This does not mean you are dead! When you become critically wounded a medic can still revive you for up to 5 minutes, saving your team valuable tickets. You can utilize Mumble to coordinate the medic to your location by using the Local channel (H) or **squad’s Radio Net (0 numpad).** In order to revive you, the medic select the **epipen** from their weapon selection and with the epipen in hand, inject and administer the epinephrine shot to the central mass area of the unconscious players torso by clicking and holding down left mouse button. The player will then become conscious but unlike in BF2, will only be at about 10% health and will still need healing. The medic and the recently revived player should find a safe area and continue the healing process there. If the player is stuck (inside a wall, tree, etc.) or is on uneven ground (hillside) it can help to **resuscitate** the body first. This will move the ragdoll body and it might become un-stuck.

**Death**

Sometimes players will not be revivable, such as when a player is killed in a vehicle. If you were recently revived and you become critically wounded again within 2 minutes, you will not be revivable the second time. If you are wounded and you are not revived within 5 minutes you will also go dead. If there is no chance of being revived, left click on **Give up/Call Medic** on the spawn screen. Now the screen will show that you are dead and you can prepare to respawn. The time you spent waiting to click give up counts toward your total respawn time.

**Re-spawning**

A player&#039;s respawn time is at least 45 seconds and at most 60 seconds plus temporary penalties. Time spent while waiting for a medic is subtracted from that time. Once a player dies he has to wait at least 5 seconds before spawning. These actions influence the respawn time:

*   Player death: **+3s**
*   Capturing CP or destroying objective: **-3s**
*   Doing a defensive action: **-1s**
*   Squad built forward outpost: **-10s**

A temporary spawn time penalty which only affects the next time you die (building up to 5 minutes) is added by these actions:

*   Teamkill: **15 seconds per teamkill**
*   Suicide: **15 seconds**
*   Civilian getting captured: **90 seconds**
*   Civilian killed violating ROE: **120 seconds per civilian**
*   Own weapons cache destroyed: **300 seconds**

To select a spawn point, bring up the spawn map and select an applicable location. Once you’re happy with that spawn location, you must click on the **Done** button in the lower right corner of the map screen to re-spawn into the game. Just waiting for the timer to expire or hitting the &lt;enter&gt; key will not automatically respawn you. If you see a very large number on the timer, such as 5999, then you haven’t clicked Done.

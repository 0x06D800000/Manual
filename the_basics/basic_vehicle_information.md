## _Basic Vehicle Information_ {#basic-vehicle-information}

Many vehicles behave quite differently compared to BF2 and require more advanced knowledge to operate. Since they also have very long spawn times (up to 20 minutes) it is vital to know how to keep them away from problematic situations. This part will focus on explaining vehicle types and how they influence the team. For more details on operating vehicles see further in this manual in the Operating Vehicles section.

There are many vehicle types in PR:BF2 used as classification. This isn’t always directly in line with their Real Life counterpart due to gameplay reasons. The following list shows you the main classes of vehicles in PR:BF2:

*   **Jeep:** small transport vehicles that not always fill the entire squad. Can always drop small ammo crates. Sometimes are fitted with machine guns nests.
*   **Civilian vehicles:** PR:BF2’s insurgent forces have access to a range of civilian cars and technicals mounted with machine guns, rocket-pods and SPG-9 recoilless rifles. They also have a flatbed with a mounted AA-gun, bomb trucks and bomb cars in their arsenal.
*   **Truck:** come in both transport and logistic variants. The transport variant is capable of dropping 1 light supply crate and can fit an entire squad. The Logistic variant can only fit 2 soldiers and can drop 2 heavy supply crates, repair stations and Close Support Bridges (more on this later).
*   **Armored Personnel Carrier (APC):** large armored vehicles more often than not armed with heavy weaponry. Often do not possess the force to defeat other heavy armored targets such as IFVs and tanks but are the best of all vehicles types at assisting infantry. Can fit 2 crewman (driver and gunner) and up to 6 soldier passengers.
*   **Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV):** Better armed and stronger than most APCs with often capabilities to defeat heavy armored targets using AT-Missiles. Are not always capable of transporting infantry. Under this category often also fall the recon-vehicles.
*   **Anti-Tank Missile Mounted Vehicle (ATM):** The name speaks for itself. These are vehicles armed with AT-missiles to destroy other armored vehicles. Cannot transport infantry.

*   **Tank:** Our heaviest of armored vehicles. They come equipped with AP, HE and COAX weaponry.
*   **Anti-Air Vehicle:** These are usually light armored vehicles with only the ability to take out enemy aircraft and helicopters. They can use missiles or/and heavy guns.
*   **Boat:** PR:BF2 has a variety of boats both armed and un-armed.
*   **Transport Helicopter:** These helicopters usually come equipped with door-guns for the mounted infantry to use.They are also capable of dropping heavy supply crates. There are light, medium and heavy transport choppers. See the section on Supply Crates to read on which variant has which crates available to it.
*   **Attack Helicopters:** These helicopters come equipped with machine-gun pods and a variety of rockets and missiles. There are light, medium and heavy variants. Recon helicopters with the ability to laze targets and use their thermal cameras also fall under this category in PR:BF2\. They are not always armed.
*   **Jets:** PR:BF2 has a wide variety of jets. There are light and heavy attack jets, fighter jets, bombers and fighter-bombers.

*   If a team vehicle asset is destroyed it incurs a ticket penalty:
*   Jeep or truck: **2 tickets**
*   Transport helicopter: **5 tickets**
*   APC/AAV/RECON: **5 tickets**
*   Tank or IFV: **10 tickets**
*   Jet or attack helicopter: **10 tickets**
*   Vehicles are **Team Locked** and you cannot operate enemy vehicles of any kind.
*   Vehicles can only **be entered from appropriate positions** on the hull.
*   Normal soldiers are allowed to drive small unarmored vehicles such as jeeps, trucks and boats without the need for any specialized kit. If you require **a crewman or pilot kit** to operate a vehicle position, you will receive a warning message upon entering it and the screen will fade to black. If you do not exit the vehicle position within a few seconds, you will die.
*   When exiting **a moving or burning vehicle** you will become wounded and possibly die. The faster the vehicle moves the greater the chance of death.
*   **Destroying vehicle wrecks** does not influence score although a warning message states otherwise when shooting friendly wrecks.
*   When manning **stationary or vehicle weapons** it takes a specific warm up time before they have the ability to fire:
*   MG: **5 seconds**
*   Anti-Air Missile: **5 seconds**
*   AT-emplacement: **10 seconds**
*   Armor main cannon: **30 seconds**
*   Most Stationary AT-Weapons have optics with fixed zoom capability. Some of them even offer thermal optics.
*   Exiting vehicles in mid-air and falling into water from high altitudes will injure you and may result in your death.
*   Players can **request kits** from a APC’s/IFV’s entry position.
*   Armored vehicles are more vulnerable when attacked from their flanks. The armor on the rear of the vehicle is the weakest. A single well-placed anti-tank projectile can disable or take them out.

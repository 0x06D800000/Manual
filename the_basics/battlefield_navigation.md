## _Battlefield Navigation_ {#battlefield-navigation}

It is pretty easy to get lost on the large maps of PR:BF2\. The slow pacing and team coordination also requires players to communicate locations in a clear and concise manner. PR:BF2 offers 4 tools to aid players with this.

1.  Squad leaders can use their **squad order marker** to communicate locations to their squad and the commander. The direction to the marker is indicated by a chevron above the compass. If you are within 75m of the marker you&#039;ll also see a 3D icon which shows the location in front of you. The marker will also be visible on the map.

**Target Build Observe**

**Defend Demolish Move**

1.  A **precision degree compass** to the bottom central area of your screen. The compass can be used to give exact bearings of nearby spotted enemies. **The 8 Cardinal Directions** are clearly indicated along with the degree bearing labels which incrementally increase every 15° with major divisions every 5°. If you just want to communicate a general direction it is best practice to say the cardinal direction, followed by the degree and in some situations the distance if appropriate. For example **_“Enemy spotted NE 75° degrees 200 meters out”_.**
    *   If the target is visually in line with a numbered bearing on your compass when you are facing that direction, you simply communicate that number.
    *   Remember that all large compass notches equal 5 degrees. If the target is in line with a notch to the right of a labelled notch along from 75° then right you add 5°. So the target is at 80°.
2.  The maps in PR:BF2 contain **grid reference labels and keypad subgrids**. The Grid labels are found on the upper and left border of the map. The map is divided into 169 grid squares starting with A1 in the upper left corner and ending with M13 in the lower right corner. Each grid square is divided in 9 subgrids. Those are labeled from 1 to 9 in the same manner as a computer&#039;s numpad are arranged. (Top row from left to right 7, 8, 9).

You can communicate locations by giving out a grid reference. For a rough location you only say the main grid field (e.g. D6). For precise locations you also add the subgrid location (e.g. D6-2). Grid references are mostly used to communicate locations between squads.

When using Mumble the first letter of the Grid reference is usually annunciated using the NATO phonetic alphabet. The codewords are Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel, India, Juliett, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, X-ray, Yankee and Zulu.

1.  **The scale of each grid** square is displayed in the bottom right hand corner of the map. A 1km map will be indicated by a 75m grid squad, 150m for a 2km and 300m for a 4km map. You can easily estimate distances on the map using the grid squares. The squad leader&#039;s squad screen also displays the approximate distance to your current squad marker below the map of the battlefield.

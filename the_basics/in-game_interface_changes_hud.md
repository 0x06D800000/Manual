## _In-game interface changes (HUD)_ {#in-game-interface-changes-hud}

*   In the PR:BF2 in-game HUD, players are notified by **player-specific messages** that can only be seen by that player. They are used to give players feedback about different in-game events for example:

- The reason why the player is not issued the kit being requested.

- The reason why the deployable asset that the player requested could not be built.

- That the player must exit the vehicle or the current seat to avoid punishment.

*   PR also uses **HQ Notifications** which is displayed large orange type at the top left of the screen. These notifications give you updates on the current objectives, mission progress and other essential messages.
*   Firing **cross-hairs** have been removed from the screen. If you want to shoot precisely, you need press the alternate firing key to aim down your weapon&#039;s sights, or use the BUIS for close quarter fighting (see the

weapons chapter).

*   **Name tags have been removed** for all players. It is vital to ID your targets before engaging to avoid friendly fire. Learning the distinction of different camo, flags and the profile shape of the factions infantry helps you ID an enemy faster. As an example, to locate a Squad Leader, look for a radio antenna extending upwards from his backpack.
*   **No health status bar** indicating your vital status. When you lose more than 25% of your health, you will start to see a red bloody screen which pulsates as you hear wounded sounds of pain. You will continue to lose health as you bleed out until you receive medical attention, if you do not you will die. If however your health drops very low, your screen will lose all color, your vision will become very blurred and you will be unable to move at speed. You will have approximately a few minutes to reach medical attention or you will die.
*   **The ammo counter** only displays the weapon&#039;s fire mode and the number of remaining magazines.
*   To estimate the **amount of rounds left** in your magazine you can open the communication rose(**Q**) and see a visual indicator of the amount of ammo left.
*   **The medic** can see how far he is done healing a soldier with the HUD in the bottom right corner. Infantry can watch the same way how long until deployable is finished shoveling.
*   There are **no kill messages** (friendly fire is an exception). Even the scoreboard will not show who is alive or dead on the enemy team. If you need to know whether someone is dead, you should look for his body.
*   Only vehicles use a permanent **mini-map** on the HUD. The full map overlay is available for everybody.
*   **The current map &amp; layer** can be viewed on the top of the screen when opening the map.
*   Using the little arrow will show you the **current map asset info overlay** of all vehicles that are on the map including the spawn times of friendly vehicles.

*   **The remaining tickets** of your team and the time left can only be viewed from the squad screen. The enemy tickets are not displayed.
*   **Suppression** happens when you are under close fire by rifles, heavy weapons or nearby explosions. The screen will appear darker and become blurred like it is shaking. This effect simulates the reduced capability to return effective fire while being suppressed by the enemy.

*   When a player is **dead,** he will not be not revivable and black screen with the words dead will be displayed instead of seeing their surroundings.
*   **The automatic map spotting system** has been removed from infantry. Air vehicles can still be spotted.
*   Officers can send a **contact** report to the commander or use their radio to manually place a marker on the

team&#039;s map. Normal soldiers can only shout a generic warning when they spot enemy units.

*   **The Radio Commo-rose (default: Q &amp; T)** contain items with two functions. Left-clicking **“RELOADING /**

**CEASE FIRE”** tells the people around you that you are changing magazines, while a right click tells them to stop shooting. The same principle applies to **“GO, GO, GO / FALL BACK”** and other such menu items.

*   You can **orientate yourself** on the map using the direction element that you will find around your player icon.
*   Whilst equipped with particular weapons or equipment the main **radio communication-rose** is replaced by a small context-sensitive menu. When holding a field dressing or the medic bag you can use the “FIRST AID” command to inform nearby players that you want to heal them. Many pieces of equipment and some weapons use context-sensitive menus.

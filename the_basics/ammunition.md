## _Ammunition_ {#ammunition}

If you run low on ammunition, you can resupply from the following locations:

*   The rifleman, militant, warrior and some insurgent kits come with **ammunition bags** that must be thrown on the ground (left click) for other soldiers or themselves. These contain a very small amount of ammo (a couple grenades and ammo clips) so they should be conserved for desperate situations. These bags can also be used to resupply your medicâ€™s supplies or deployable weapon emplacements by throwing the bag next to the weapon (i.e. TOW or AA). Once the bag is used up it will disappear.
*   Light transport vehicles and APCs / IFVs can drop one or more **large ammunition crates.** Ammo boxes are deployed by the driver by right clicking. Vehicles can reload their ammunition boxes at a supply depot.
*   Logistics trucks and helicopters can drop **supply crates.** They either drop a Light or Heavy supply crate which has an appropriate amount of ammunition. New supply crates can be loaded at the supply depot (for vehicles) or helipad (for helicopters). See more on supply crates on the next page.
*   Insurgency maps contain **weapons caches** which provide an unlimited amount of ammunition to the insurgents.
*   You can also resupply directly from the **vehicle depot** by standing within a few meters of it. It provides an unlimited supply of ammunition to the team and can also rearm vehicles. It will also heal wounded infantry.
*   Resupplying is **not instant** but takes about 10-30 seconds.
*   It is not possible to get supplies from **enemy supply crates**.
*   New ammo bags can be collected from supply crates if you have used your ammunition in the field.

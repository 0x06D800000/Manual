## _Score_ {#score}

A player&#039;s score is divided in teamwork points and individual points. It speaks for itself that doing team related activities (building, driving vehicles, defending/attacking flags) contribute to the first and individual actions (killing players) contribute to your personal score.

The total score of a player can never go below 0 but the teamwork score can become negative. There are also score multipliers for when you are for example in a vehicle or a squad leader. Here are some other score additions and deductions. These are not all but give you a good idea on what you can achieve.

*   Capturing a civilian: **+100**
*   Killing a civilian (outside ROE): **-100**
*   Destroying your own objective: **-100**
*   Destroying enemy objective: **+150**

## _Mortars_ {#mortars}

A fixed mortar position that can provide indirect fire support over long distances. All factions can fire high-explosive rounds. Conventional forces and the militia can also use air-burst and smoke rounds. Mortars cannot be constructed on maps smaller than 2km.

*   **High Explosive (HE)** (press **1** to select): Most common type of mortar round. Does the most damage directly to the target. Ideal for light armored targets and emplacements.
*   **Airburst** (press **2** to select): Explodes in the air above the ground. Covers a larger area but does less damage overall. Ideal for engaging infantry inside buildings and on uneven terrain.

Once mortars are needed you can use the mortar’s calculator (press **3** to select). The distance to the target and the difference in elevation can be entered into the calculator by clicking on the numbers in the **“Range”** and **“Height”** fields. To get the range make sure you SL’s marker is on the target, then open the map and you’ll find the range listed under the map. Once you are done just click the **“Calculate”** button to display the required barrel elevation. The elevation can be adjusted with the W and S keys while the deflection is changed using the A and D keys. When both values are set, just select the required rounds and fire. There are both Air-Burst and Impact rounds available that share ammunition.

## _Kit selection &amp; spawning_ {#kit-selection-spawning}

*   When you begin playing, it is recommended that you only spawn as a rifleman with a sight of your choice. This way you can better learn the fundamental basics of gameplay.
*   After learning infantry basics you can ask your SL to assign you a specialized kit when you feel up to the task. If you want to try out new equipment or a vehicle, you can do so easily in the co-op mode without inconveniencing your squad members or risking your team&#039;s assets.
*   Kits that are specialized and more difficult to operate are generally limited and can only be obtained if certain conditions are met within a squad. These reserved kits are of limited supply to the team and you should always ask before requesting one.
*   Kits can be requested from the main spawn menu (like BF2), a supply crate [_(see Logistics section)_](logistics.md) or the rear of an APC / IFV. To have the ability to request a kit from a supply crate or vehicle, you must be a part of a squad.

In PR:BF2 you cannot spawn at every control point that your team controls. Spawn points available in PR:BF2 are:

*   **Your squad&#039;s rally point (RP)** is a green circle surrounding a spawn point with your squad’s number adjacent to it. Depending on the location of your squad’s RP in relation to a team’s FOB will determine its longevity. Note: If you spawn on another squad’s rally point, you will automatically spawn at your own rally point, or any nearby FOB. If none available you will be moved to the main base of your team. If overrun by the enemy, your squad’s RP will disappear. RPs are only available to conventional forces. _(To learn more about rally points see_ [_the Rally Point section_](../the_squad_leader/rally_points.md)_)_
*   **Map-specific team rally points**. These usually expire 5 minutes after the round starts and can be used by the whole team. These also only allow maximum 12 people to spawn on it until it disappears.
*   **The commander rally point**. This RP can only be placed by the commander, provided multiple squad’s leaders are in the vicinity of the CO. On the map this will be a rally point with a “C” next to it.
*   **Deployable forward operating base (FOB) or hideouts** can be used by the entire team to spawn at, but must be constructed before becoming operational. If 2 enemies get close to them (within 50m), spawning is disabled for 90 seconds. On the map it will show as a spawn point with a green triangle. [_(see deployables Section)_](../the_squad_leader/deployable_structures.md)_._
*   In the insurgency game mode, the defending insurgent team may spawn at the **weapons caches** that hasn&#039;t been revealed to the enemy, this is called the unknown cache. This spawn is also disabled if enemies becomes to close.
*   **Your team&#039;s headquarters, main base or permanent FOB.** This is the only spawn point that is always available.

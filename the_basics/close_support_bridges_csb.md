## _Close Support Bridges (CSB)_ {#close-support-bridges-csb}

Conventional forces can deploy these bridges using their logistics trucks. They can be used to create new crossings or to span the gaps in damaged bridges. The deployment process for CSBs is very simple:

1.  Drive a logistics truck to the position where the CSB will be deployed.
2.  Position the back of the truck as close as possible to the deployment position.
3.  Select the CSB as active equipment of the truck.
4.  Press alternate fire to deploy the bridge.

The CSB can only be used at predetermined positions. These are indicated by small heaps of sand positioned across a natural obstacle. Some obstacles require multiple CSBs to span the complete distance.

Deploying a CSB uses all supplies on the truck. The truck needs to be fully loaded for the bridge to deploy. (Both supply crates must still be on the truck). The CSB is very narrow, so drive carefully when crossing the bridge.

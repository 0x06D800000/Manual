## _Logistics_ {#logistics}

There are many forms of logistics in PR:BF2\. Supply crates, repair drop, ammunition, deployable structures, etc. Here we discuss only supply crates and repair drop. To learn more about deployable emplacements that can be built see the [Squad Leader Chapter](../the_squad_leader/construction_work.md).

**Supply Crates**

There are two types of supply crates in PR:BF2\. The ownership of the crate is depicted by the flag display on top of the crate. The Light Supply Crate can be transported by the Light Lift classification of Helicopters such as the Huey, Lynx and Zhi-9B. The Heavy Supply Crate which contains twice the ammunition of the Light Supply Crate can be transported by Medium Lift Helicopters such as the Black Hawk, Mi-17 and NH-90, and by Heavy Lift Helicopters such as the Chinook, Zhi-8KA and MV-22\. Medium Lift Helicopters can hold 1 Heavy Supply Crate whilst its heavier brothers can carry 2 Heavy Supply Crates. A logistics truck holds 2 large supply crates while a transport truck holds 1 light supply crate.

_Here you can see the heavy supply crate on the left and the light version on the right._

When building deployables (see the Squad Leader section) a Light Supply Crate is the equivalent of half of the Heavy Supply Crate. This means you will need 2 light supply crates or one heavy supply crate to build a FOB and 4 light supply crates or 2 heavy supply crates for the addition of deployable emplacements. The heavy and light supply crates can also be combined to build a deployable defense. The system will allow you to have a mix of different crates, such as two Light Supply Crates and one Heavy Supply crate to meet the same requirement as two Heavy Supply Crates, or four Light Supply crates.

**Repair Drop**

Logistic trucks also have the ability to drop a repair station. They are necessary for field repairs to vehicles that are heavily damaged and cannot move.
